### Understanding Base Light Level
Item drop level is based on your **Base Light Level** and not your **Effective
Light Level** (ELL for short). **Base Light Level** (BLL for short) is your gear
light level, minus any mods.

This means if your gun is 275 and has a +5 mod then your BLL for that gun is 270. 
This means if the BLL of your character is 280, and you add +5 mods to all
your gear, your ELL will be 282. legendary engrams and item drops will still
drop at 280 since that is your BLL.

You can only infuse the BLL. If you have a 275 gun with a +5 mod then it’s BLL
is 270. If you attempt to infuse the gun into a 270 gun, destiny will tell you
the base light level is not high enough.

### Leveling Strategy

1. Hold on to reputation tokens and faction tokens. Turning in rep tokens will
   always grant you gear at your BLL. Engrams do have a chance to drop with a
   +5 mod attached, but that gear is not useful for infusing because you can’t
   infuse the +5 mod only the BLL.
2. Buy gear mod packs from the weapon vendor when you hit the max glimmer cap,
   you don't want to throw away glimmer and you will use these mods later to buy
   legendary mods. Also, buy legendary mod packs when you can, they cycle
   daily. It’s nice to have a collection on hand so you can pick and choose
   mods when you get a nice drop and helps you keep your ELL up.
3.  Only turn in reputation tokens once you have gained an additional BLL level
    by turning in the weekly milestones or Cayde’s treasure hunt, or nightfall
    and you have increased your BLL. Only then you can use the rep gear and drops to
    upgrade all your other gear.
4. Don’t turn in milestones (quests that grant “powerful gear”) without having
   your max light gear on.
5. Essentially you ALWAYS want your max light gear on, Anytime a exotic could
   drop (Public Events, Strikes, PvP, etc..) it drops based on your current BLL
   level. According to what I’ve seen, exotics can drop at your BLL plus 1 or
   15 light levels higher (this doesn’t include the +5 mod that all exotics have)
   Which means it’s possible to get an exotic drop with a ELL of 20 light
   levels higher than your current BLL. (I had an BLL of 274, when my MIDA
   Mutli-Tool dropped at ELL of 294)

Just by holding on to my rep tokens, and waiting for an exotic drop of BLL +1
or more, I’ve been able to gain a light level almost every day I play.
