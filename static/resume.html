                <p>
                    I’m a software engineer with 16 years of on the job experience fluent in
                    Python, GoLang, Javascript, AngularJS and HTML5 in addition to experience with
                    Java, PHP, Perl and C/C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experienced with both backend server development and frontend UI/UX. I’ve done
                    just about everything in the technology industry from kernel module to mobile
                    game development. I’ve been an openstack contributor; I’ve run a small game
                    startup, a few open source projects and several development teams, not only as
                    technical lead but as mentor and project manager. I enjoy building systems with
                    an eye for usability, sustainability and availability. I also enjoy being a
                    liaison for teams and individuals and bringing individuals together to clear
                    roadblocks for joint projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most recently I’ve been lecturing on containers and kubernetes as I believe
                    these represent the future of building robust, sustainable and highly available
                    systems. I am actively seeking opportunities to work with kubernetes in a
                    production environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, my former employees said I was the best boss they ever worked for. Which
                    is cool because I didn’t pay them a lot, so I must have been awesome =D

                    There may be non-exported or anonymous

                    dynamically from another package.

                <p>
                    Click a node to visit that function's source code.
                    From there you can visit its callers by

        <h2 id="pkg-variables">Work History</h2>

            Working as a developer in the industry for 16+ years
        <h3 id="hdr-Developer_III___Rackspace_2013_2016">Developer III - Rackspace 2013-2016</h3>
        <p>
            Welcomed back to the rackspace family by the same team (Cloud Block
            Storage). I continued to support the product while striving to make the
            system more reliable and supportable. Continued mentoring and giving talks,
            Introduced golang for our backend support services. Created development
            roadmaps, mockups and coded Encore UI pages for support to gain insight into
            CBS and provide fanatical support. Wrote tons of supportability scripts and
            operations tools using SALT/Python. Joined the Intel/Rackspace OSIC
            initiative with the high level goal of encouraging enterprise adoption by
            focusing development on capabilities that simplify daily operation.

        <h3 id="hdr-Partner___BubbleZap_Games_2012_2013">Partner - BubbleZap Games 2012-2013</h3>
        <p>
            Me and a partner developed a SuperNES emulator in our spare time beginning
            late 2007 and eventually launched on the android market with little success.
            Only after google started to crack down on GPL violators did our emulator
            begin to gain traction around 2011-2012. Soon we had enough income to employ
            both the original founders an additional developer, and two artists. After a
            heartbreaking fall out with my partner I left the company and returned to
            Rackspace.
        </p>

        <p>
            While filling the role of a developer; I continued to seek ways of improving
            process and create tools that help eliminate non-value add tasks. I write
            documentation in the form of procedures and guidelines for myself and
            others. I have fixed complex technical problems and provided complete
            solutions in a timely manner and in critical situations. I continue to
            actively mentor and encourage others to embrace change and improve the
            quality of their work.
